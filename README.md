**ALPHA BUILD, DO NOT USE YET**

dbj string manipulations in C

This is C code that has a requirement to 
compile in WandBox. Hence a single c file and all the stuff in headers.
And all static functions in headers.

Seems a bit crazy but is the easiest way 
to copy/paste relatively quickly into the working WandBox.com workspace.

Also the general aim is to use gcc 4.4.7 while in the WandBox.org

In case you want to "take it over" the easiest is to fork from GitHub.
Alternatively take the zip  and rearange to your liking in your project(s).
